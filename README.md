# Adaptive_JRRM

Next generation of wireless networks will be a combination of multiple radio access technologies which form a heterogeneous wireless network.
The main purpose of this network is to realize the “always best connected” concept i.e. the user must connect to a network which meets its service requirements in the best manner, all the time and everywhere.
To get the most out of radio resources in heterogeneous networks, Joint Radio Resource Management (JRRM) method applied. 
In this project we’ve introduced the adaptive JRRM method which selects the most appropriate Radio Access Technology (RAT) considering various parameters, such as user’s mobile behavior model. 
Numerical results show that using this method, besides decreasing service cost for operators, vertical handoff rate between RATs also decreased which resulted in a more stable connection for users. 

In fact here is the code implementation of Petri net model introduced in this project for the handoff of user. 
The [Adaptive JRRM paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7030331/) presents the results of this project.
